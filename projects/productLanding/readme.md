#Zero to Mastery - complete web developer
[ZtM course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-developer-in-2018/)
I started this course because I felt like my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills weren't equal to each other.  I was getting more and more confident in JS, but found myself spending way too long on simple CSS. 

Hopefully this course provides the structure to improve all at the same pace.

This repo is all the files and folders from that course.

It's a bit of a mess, but I'll organise it better.
